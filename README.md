# Blog Layout
This is a simple blog layout using HTML,CSS,JS, and flexbox. This small project utilzes JS click handlers to allow for the user to click on an image and display a modal container. I also used JS to create elements within the page as well as to generate the images as the page is loaded instead of storing images in an image folder.
